chmod +x ec2.py

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/devel/contrib/inventory/ec2.ini

Test the script by itself to make sure your config is correct:
./ec2.py –list

ansible -i ec2.py -u ansible all -m ping
or
ansible -i ec2.py -u ansible us-east-1 -m ping


N.B: You can filter for specific EC2 instances by creating an environment variable
named EC2_INSTANCE_FILTERS, which has the same format as the instance filters. For example, to find all hosts whose name begins with 'webserver',

•	export EC2_INSTANCE_FILTERS='tag:Name=Webserver*'
•	then



•	Inside file -> ec2.ini   		-> add the below line
•	instance_filters = tag:Name=Webserver*

Then run command, 
•	ansible -i ec2.py -u ansible tag_Name_Webserver* -m ping
