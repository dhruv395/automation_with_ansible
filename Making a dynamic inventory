 ##Ansible supports two ways to connect with external inventory: Inventory Plugins and inventory scripts.

####Inventory Script Example: AWS EC2

Cd /etc/ansible
Wget  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/devel/contrib/inventory/ec2.py

chmod +x ec2.py

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/devel/contrib/inventory/ec2.ini

Test the script by itself to make sure your config is correct:
./ec2.py --list
After a few moments, you should see your entire EC2 inventory across all regions in JSON.

ansible -i ec2.py -u ansible all -m ping
or
ansible -i ec2.py -u ansible us-east-1 -m ping

########## To successfully make an API call to AWS, you will need to configure Boto (the Python interface to AWS). 
There are a variety of methods available, but the simplest is just to export two environment variables:

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='AK123'
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='abc123'

N.B: You can filter for specific EC2 instances by creating an environment variable
named EC2_INSTANCE_FILTERS, which has the same format as the instance filters. For example, to find all hosts whose name begins with 'webserver',

•	export EC2_INSTANCE_FILTERS='tag:Name=Webserver*'
•	then

•	Inside file -> ec2.ini   		-> add the below line
•	instance_filters = tag:Name=Webserver*

Then run command, 
•	ansible -i ec2.py -u ansible tag_Name_Webserver* -m ping
