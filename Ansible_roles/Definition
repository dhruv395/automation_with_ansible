Roles are a way to group multiple tasks together into one container to do the automation in a very effective manner.
With clean directory structure. 
Roles are a set of tasks and additional files for a certain role which allow you to break up the configuration. 
It can be easily reused the codes by anyone if the role is suitable to someone. 
It can be easily modified and reduce syntax error.

### tasks - contains the main list of tasks to be executed by the role. Installing packages, copying files. 

### handlers - tasks based on some actions. Triggers. E.g; incase httpd.conf changes,  
It should trigger service restart. 

#### defaults - default variables for the role or data about the role. E.g; port no.  

#### vars - both vars & defaults store variables. Variables stored under var has higher priority and difficult to override.  E.g; diff port no, document root
