In Ansible, the role is the primary mechanism for breaking a playbook into multiple files. This simplifies writing complex playbooks, 
and it makes them easier to reuse. The breaking of playbook allows you to logically break the playbook into reusable components.

Role directory structure:

tasks/main.yml - the main list of tasks that the role executes.

handlers/main.yml - contains handlers which can be invoked by “notify” directives and are associated with service.

defaults/main.yml - default variables for the role. These variables have the lowest priority of any variables available, and can be easily overridden 
by any other variable, including inventory variables.

vars/main.yml - contains variables for the role. Variables in vars have higher priority than variables in defaults directory.

files/main.yml - files that the role deploys or files which we want to be copied to the remote host. Files contains static data.

templates/main.yml - similar to files but contains dynamic data. We use the Jinja2 templating language for creating templates.

meta/main.yml - contains metadata of role like an author, support platforms, including role dependencies.
